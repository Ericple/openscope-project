                              PREAMBLE

I wrote this software mainly for those linux user who want to be a 
controller but restricted by windows based Euroscope controller 
software. This software instead, supports Windows / Linux / macOS. I
made it open source because I want to grow a community of controller,
in which there are all people full of passion for challenge, and have
the courage to break free.
