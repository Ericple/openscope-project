> Openscope is a cross-platform controller terminal for [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/) FSD Server (not recognized yet) & [TeleFlight Server](https://openvmsys.cn/tfs/#/), supporting Windows / Linux / macOS. I wrote this software mainly for those linux users who want to be a controller but restricted by windows based Euroscope controller software. I made it open source because I want to grow a community of controller,in which there are all people full of passion for challenge, and havethe courage to break free.
