> Openscope is a cross-platform controller terminal for [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/) FSD Server (not recognized yet) & [TeleFlight Server](https://openvmsys.cn/tfs/#/), supporting Windows / Linux / macOS. I wrote this software mainly for those linux (and of course, macOS!) users who want to be a controller but restricted by windows based Euroscope controller software. I made it open source because I want to grow a community of controller, in which there are men and women full of passion for challenge, and have the courage to break free.

# Contributing

All contributions are welcomed. Before forking this repository, please consider the followings:

- Am I familier with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)?
- Am I familier with [Euroscope](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/) and its configuration files?
- Do I know the basic knowledge of ATC?

## Debug

For the first start, run:

```
npm i && npm run start
```

Afterwards, upon each debugging, if you did not edit any file in /pages or /config, use `npm run quicks` to skip the asset copying process. Otherwise, you still need
to use `npm run start` to start debugging.

# FAQ

- <del>The freetexts are covered by the airport polygon, what should I do?</del> ***(This bug should have been fixed)***
  - Please refers to the .asr file your sector loads, open it with the text editor you like, find those lines prefixed with "Regions:", cut all these lines and paste it under "SECTORTITLE:", like the example belowï¼š
  ```
    DisplayTypeName:Standard ES radar screen
    DisplayTypeNeedRadarContent:1
    DisplayTypeGeoReferenced:1
    SECTORFILE:
    SECTORTITLE:
    ;The Regions should be right under the "SECTORTITLE:" line
    Regions:ZSSS:polygon
    Regions:ZSPD:polygon
    ......
  ```
